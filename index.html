              <h3>Introduction to Chinese SOEs</h3>

              <p>On August 24, 2015, in one day of trading, 8.5 percent of the value of the Shanghai stock market was wiped out. This crash was largely prompted by fears of slowing economic growth in China. For years, the Chinese Communist Party has had a so-called “Grand Bargain” with the peasants and middle class; they tolerated a repressive, authoritarian regime and, in turn, received economic growth and prosperity. However, the prospect of slowing economic growth could cause a collapse of this agreement, with potential repercussions across all of Chinese society. China’s economy, which has long been the focal point of the CCP’s attention, is unique amongst world economies in that it is somewhere in between capitalist and socialist. While China has been encouraging additional private investment for the past two decades, large parts of the economy are still controlled by the CCP through state-owned enterprises, or SOEs. These SOEs are a sort of middle ground between state and private ownership: many of them act like private companies, with some even publically traded, but the one thing that they all have in common is that their strategic decisions are made by the Party. [more intro?] China’s unwillingness to divest some of its control over the economy through SOEs will undermine China’s economic growth, as well as social stability within China.</p>

              <h3>Historical Context</h3>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>The roots of the present crisis can be traced back through history all the way to Mao Zedong and some of his first major reforms after winning the Chinese Civil War. As a Communist, one of Mao’s core ideals was collective ownership and working of the land. His most major reform towards this goal was the Great Leap Forward in 1956, in which “99 percent of the rural population” had their lands reorganized into “26,000 centralized People’s Communes” (Green 244). This enormous reorganization of China’s farmland marked the beginning of state ownership on a massive scale, but it was not without its consequences. Mao grossly overestimated the production of these communes and, as a result, historians estimated that the famines caused by the Great Leap Forward caused “20 million to as many as 45 million deaths” (Green 245). While state ownership is not necessarily a bad concept as a whole, these tragic events showed that the bureaucratic ineffectiveness of the CCP would prove to be a major obstacle to state ownership in the future.</p>
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>Furthermore, after the death of Mao, the economic liberalizations made by Deng Xiaoping greatly increased China’s economic growth. One of the largest changes as part of Deng’s “Four Modernizations” was the opening of the economy and slight relaxing of state controls. In doing this, Deng “lured foreign investors to China…setting the stage for China’s three-decade-long economic boom” (Barboza). Encouraging foreign investment was one of the ways that the CCP set up China’s economic boom, and they saw that by loosening their grip on China’s economy slightly, they were able to greatly increase China’s economic productivity. This loosening of economic controls was one of the reasons why the CCP was able to meet Deng’s ambitious target of “quadrupling Gross National Product…from $250 billion to $1 trillion” (Whitten 292) by 2000.</p>

              <br>
              <p>Through these reforms, the CCP saw that loosening their grip on the economy could have a greatly positive impact on China’s economy as a whole. However, the CCP is an authoritarian regime which has its own interests foremost in its decision making. They were in a position where they wanted to remove economic controls to let the economy grow, but at the same time wanted to maintain their iron-fisted control over the economy.</p>
